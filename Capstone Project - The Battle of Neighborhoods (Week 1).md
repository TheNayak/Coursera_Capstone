### Some Context:
Vasudev Krishna a hotelier runs a chain of Pizza restaurants under the brand name of Vaikunta Pizzaria in the city of Mumbai, India. Building on the success of his venture he wants to expand his business into a new city of Bengaluru, India. While doing his reserch Vasudev finds out that his friend Gandivdhari Arjuna, an aspiring data scientist has recently completed IBM DATA SCIENCE professional certificate. Vasudev has requested Arjuna to help him in his problem.

### Business Problem:
Vasudev wants to expand his Pizza chain into the markets of Bengaluru, India. But first he must do some reserch. His main dilemma is to decide as to where will he locate his restaurants in Bengaluru. He wants to expand into areas that have the least pizza restaurants in their vicinity, neighborhoods that are not known for their pizza restaurants. He is confident that his pizza will find buyers as they are literally the food of the gods. Hence he enlists the help of his dear friend Arjuna, who with his recent working with machine learning techniques and the foursquare API has promised Vasudev that he will solve his dilemma. Arjuna has promised Vasudev that he will look up details on all the neighbourhoods in bengaluru and find out which of them have popular pizza places within them.
